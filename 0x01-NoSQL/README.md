NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It's a term used to describe databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data and are often used in big data and real-time web applications.

Here's a breakdown of your questions:

Difference between SQL and NoSQL:

SQL databases (relational databases) store data in tables and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They are typically used for structured data with a fixed schema.
NoSQL databases, on the other hand, can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, or graph-based. They are more flexible and scalable, suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data and dynamic schemas.
ACID:

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It's a set of properties that guarantee the reliability of database transactions. ACID-compliant databases ensure that database transactions are processed reliably, even in the event of system failures.
Document storage:

Document storage is a type of NoSQL database model where data is stored in a semi-structured format, typically in documents (like JSON or XML). Each document contains key-value pairs, and the structure can vary from one document to another within the same collection.
NoSQL types:

NoSQL databases can be categorized into several types, including:
Document databases (e.g., MongoDB)
Key-value stores (e.g., Redis)
Column-family stores (e.g., Cassandra)
Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j)
Benefits of a NoSQL database:

NoSQL databases offer benefits such as horizontal scalability, flexible schema design, and better performance for certain types of applications, especially those dealing with big data and real-time data processing.
Querying information from a NoSQL database:

Querying in NoSQL databases varies depending on the type of database. For document databases like MongoDB, you typically use a query language specific to that database (e.g., MongoDB Query Language). Queries are often based on JSON-like syntax and can retrieve documents based on criteria such as key-value pairs or nested fields.
Insert/update/delete information from a NoSQL database:

Similarly, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a NoSQL database depends on the database type. For MongoDB, you would use commands provided by the MongoDB API to perform these operations. These commands allow you to insert documents, update existing documents, and delete documents based on specified criteria.
Using MongoDB:

To use MongoDB, you first need to install MongoDB on your system or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas. Then, you can interact with MongoDB using its official drivers for various programming languages. You can connect to the MongoDB server, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the MongoDB Query Language or the MongoDB API, and manage databases and collections as needed. There are also numerous resources and tutorials available online to guide you through using MongoDB effectively.
